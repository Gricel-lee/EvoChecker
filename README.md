# EvoChecker

EvoChecker is a search-based software engineering approach and tool that employs multiobjective optimisation genetic algorithms to automate the synthesis of approximate Pareto-optimal probabilistic models associated with the QoS requirements of a software system.

It is the outcome of the research paper "Search-Based Synthesis of Probabilistic Models for Quality-of-Service Softwate Engineering"
